  Q3) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example.
  
  Answer) 
  
          "this" keyword:- In java "this" keyword used to access method of the current class.
          
          uses of the "this" keyword:- 
         
         1. It use to refer instance variable of the current class.
         2. To invoke or initiate current class constructor.
         3. Can be passed as an argument in the method call.
         4. Can be passed as an argument in the constructor call.
         5. Can be used to return the current class instance.
         
         
         example:--
         
         class check 
         {
			    int a = 10;
			    static int b = 20;
 
    void checkMethod()
    {
        
        this.a = 100;
        System.out.println(a)
        this.b = 600;
 
        System.out.println(b);
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       
        new check().checkMethod();
    }
}
         
         
         "super" keyword:- In java "super" keyword used to access method of the parent class.
         
         uses of the "super" keyword:-
         
         1. It can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable
         2. It can be used to refer immediate parent class method
         3. It can be used to refer immediate parent class constructor.
         4. super keyword in java programming language refers to the superclass of the class where the super keyword is currently being used.
         5. The most common use of super keyword is that it eliminates the confusion between the superclasses and subclasses that have methods
            with same name.
            
            
            example:--
            
            
            public class Parent
             {

				int a = 10;
			    static int b = 20;

 
				 public class Child extends Parent
				 {
				
					
					    void run()
					    {
					        System.out.println(super.a);
					        System.out.println(super.b);
					    }
				 }

 
				    public static void main(String[] args)
				    {
				        new Child().run();
				    }
          }
