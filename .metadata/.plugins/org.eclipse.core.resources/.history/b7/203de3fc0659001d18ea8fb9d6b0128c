 Q1. What do you mean by the IOC, explain the life cycle of the Spring Bean.
 
 Answer) The IOC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects. The IOC container gets informations from the XML 
         file and works accordingly.
         
         There are 5 stages of spring bean class in life cycle

		1. Not exist
		2. Instansiate
		3. Sntialized
		4. Service
		5. Destroy
		
		
		1)At first there s no spring bean object exist.if bean object is singleton scope bean will load by container
		at a time of loading xml file.
		
		
		2)After this Container load the bean class into the memory and creates the bean class object 
		also uses some property and value tags to insert data in bean fields.Also all the dependencies
		is also resolved at a time of loading.
		
		3) In any bean class if there is init method is configured container will call that method automatically.
		
		4)In Service phase Container provides bean object ref to client,and client and call the service mthod on that 
		bean object.
		
		5)Same as init method we have to configure destroy method and call that method by bean object 
		to destroy bean object.
