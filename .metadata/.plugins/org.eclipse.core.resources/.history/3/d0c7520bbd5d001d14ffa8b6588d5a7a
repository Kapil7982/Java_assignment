 Q1/- What is a Servlet ? What is the role of the DispatcherServlet in the Spring boot rest application.
 
 Answer)  Servlet is used to create a web application. There are many interfaces and classes in the Servlet API such as Servlet, GenericServlet,
          HttpServlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse, etc. It is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.
	  
		  The role of the DispatcherServlet in the Spring boot rest application is it receives all of the HTTP requests and delegates them to 
		  controller classes. Spring Boot provides the spring-boot-starter-web library for developing web applications using Spring MVC. One of the 
		  main features of Spring Boot is auto-configuration. The Spring Boot auto-configuration registers and configures the DispatcherServlet 
		  automatically.
