 Q3) Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.
 
 Answer)  The key difference between equals and hashCode in Java is that the equals is used to compare two objects while the hashCode is used in 
          hashing to decide which group an object should be categorized into.
          
          
         equals():- The equals method is used to compare two objects. The default equals method is defined in the object class. That implementation
                    is similar to the == operator. The two object references are equal only if they are pointing to the same object. It is possible
                    to override the equals method.
                    
         1. equals is a method in Java that acts similar to the == operator, which is to test for object identity rather than object equality.
         2. The method equals is used to compare two objects.
                    
                    
         HashCode():- The hashCode is used in hashing to decide to which group an object should be categorized into. A group of objects can share 
                      the same hashCode. A correct hashing function can evenly distribute objects into different groups.

                      A correct hashCode can have properties as follows. Suppose that there are two objects as obj1 and obj2. If obj1.equals(obj2) 
                      is true, then the obj1.hashCode() is equal to obj2.hashCode(). If obj1.equals(obj2) is false, it is not necessary that 
                      obj1.hashCode() is not equal to obj2.hashCode(). The two unequal object might also have the same hashCode.
                      
         1. hashCode is a method by which a class implicitly or explicitly break down the data stored in an instance of the class into a single 
            hash value.
         2. The method is used in hashing to decide which group an object should be placed into.
