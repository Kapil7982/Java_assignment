 Q1) Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
 
 Answer)  ArrayList and LinkedList both implement the List interface and maintain insertion order. Both are non-synchronized classes.
 
          ArrayList:-
          
        1. ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
        2. Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the other 
           elements are shifted in memory.
        3. An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
        4. ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
        5. The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.
        6. To be precise, an ArrayList is a resizable array.
        
        
          LinkedList:- 
          
        1. LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
        2. Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
        3. LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
        4. LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
        5. The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.
        6. LinkedList implements the doubly linked list of the list interface.
        
        
        
        Example:-  
        
        
        import java.util.*;  
        
        class Test{    
			 public static void main(String args[]){    
			     
			  List<String> al=new ArrayList<String>();    
			  al.add("Ravi");   
			  al.add("Kavi");    
			  al.add("Navi");    
			  al.add("Savi");    
			    
			  List<String> al2=new LinkedList<String>(); 
			  al2.add("Mohit");   
			  al2.add("Sohit");    
			  al2.add("Lohit");    
			  al2.add("Rohit");    
			    
			  System.out.println("arraylist: "+al);  
			  System.out.println("linkedlist: "+al2);  
			 }    
}
