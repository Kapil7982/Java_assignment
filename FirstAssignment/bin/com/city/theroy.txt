1. Explain Type casting and its types with examples?

Ans) Typecast is a way of changing an object from one data type to the next. It is used in computer programming to ensure a function handles the variables correctly.
 A typecast example is the transformation of an integer into a string.
 
2. Explain the difference between local and instance variables?

Ans)
     Instance Variable:- 
 i) They are defined in class but outside the body of methods.  
 ii) It can be accessed throughout the class.
 iii) These variables are given a default value if it is not assigned by code.
 iv) It is not compulsory to initialize instance variables before use.  
 v) It includes access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.  
 
     Local Variable :-
  i) They are defined as a type of variable declared within programming blocks or subroutines. 
  ii) Its access is limited to the method in which it is declared.
  iii) These variables do not always have some value, so there must be a value assigned by code.
  iv) It is important to initialize local variables before use.
  v) It does not include any access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.
