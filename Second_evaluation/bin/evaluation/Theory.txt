 Q1) a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

Answer) String is immutable in java because of the security, synchronization and class loading. The reason of making the 
        string final is to destroy the immutability and not allow anyone to extend it. The string object are cached in the 
        string pool and it makes the string immutable.
        
        Difference between string and stringBuilder:-
        
        1. Mutability :-  A string is immutable in java, while a stringBuilder is mutable in java. An immutable object is an object whose 
                          content can't changed after it is created.
        
        2. Equality :- We can use equal() method for comparing two strings in java since the string class overrides the equal() method of the object
                       class, while in stringBuilder doesn't allow override the equal() method. We cannot use equal() method to compare two string in 
                       stringBuilder object.
                       
        3. Comparable :- In string class implements the comparable interface, while in stringBuilder doesn't because it doesn't provide any mechanism 
                         for the string comparison.
                         
        4. Constructor :- In string we can create the string object without using a new operator which is not possible in stringBuilder.
        
        5. Performance :- StringBuilder is speedy and consume less memory while string is immutable to concatenate two string it involve to create new
                          object.
                          
         Methods of string class:-  
         
         1. concat()
         2. contains()
         3. charAt()
         4. valueOf()
         5. replace()
         6. compareTo()
         
         
         
         
         
  b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
       following code snippets and giving proper explanation.
       
  Answer)   Both equals() method and == operators are use to compare two objects in java. Whenever we create an object using the operator new it will
          create new memory location for the object. So we use the == operator to check memory location or address of the two objects are the same
          or not. 
        1.  The equals() method is a method and the == operator is not a method. 
        2. equal() method evaluates the comparisons of the values in the objects, while == operator checks for the address.
        
        
        Code snippet 1 >
        
        Answer) True, because the equals() method checks for the value of the object and the value of both objects are same that's why the output 
                of the code is true.
                
         Code snippet 2 >  
         
        Answer) False, because stringBuilder is mutable and it create different objects every time that's why s1 is not equal to s2 hence the output 
                is false.
                
        Code snippet 3 >
        
        Answer) False, because == operator is checks for the objects and the objects address are same but both objects are different that's why the 
                output is false.
