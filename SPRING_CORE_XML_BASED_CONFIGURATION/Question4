		1. ByName :- If bean id value in xml file matches the property name of dependent bean then container perform the setter injection into the 
		             dependent class. If there is no dependencies in that those property value remains null.
		
		2. ByType :- If bean class in xml file matches the property type  of dependent bean then container perform the setter injection into the 
		             dependent class. If there is no dependencies in that those property  type remains null.
		
		3. Constructor :- In this value of autowire it injects the dependencies using constructor injection not using setter injection mechanism.
