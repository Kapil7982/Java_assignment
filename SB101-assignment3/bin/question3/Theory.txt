 Q3) What is exception handling in java, Write the hierarchy of Exception class and, Mention someof the predefined Exception classes at least 5, 
     and the reason when those exception class object is generated in our application.
     
 Answer)  Exception Handling:- Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of 
                               the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as 
                               ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
                               
          Exception Hierarchy:- All exception and error types are subclasses of class Throwable, which is the base class of the hierarchy. One 
                                branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. 
                                NullPointerException is an example of such an exception. Another branch, Error is used by the Java run-time 
                                system to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment itself.
                               
                               Object
			                     |
		                     Throwable
                                                            
           -------------------------------------------------------------------
           |					                                             |
       Exception 				                                           Error
           |
     RuntimeException
     
     
             
             Predefined Exception in Java:- 
             
             1. ArthmeticException
             2. ClassCastException
             3. ClassNotFoundException
             4. FileNotFoundException
             5. NullPointerException
             
             
             
             Major reason why an Exception occurs:- 
             
             1. Physical limitations like out of disk memory
             2. Code errors
             3. Opening an unavailable file
             4. Invalid user input  
             5. Device failure 
             6. Loss of network connection
