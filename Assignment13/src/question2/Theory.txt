 Q2) Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?
 
 Answer) Because, It is just to remove the ambiguity , because multiple inheritance can cause ambiguity around Diamond problem in few scenarios.
         For example, if you have two parent classes, they might have different implementations of the same feature â€” or possibly two different 
         features with the same name. Then you have to deal with deciding which one your subclass is going to use. There are ways of handling this,
         but the designers of Java felt that multiple inheritance causes more problems and confusion than it solves. So they avoid multiple 
         inheritance from the Java language.
