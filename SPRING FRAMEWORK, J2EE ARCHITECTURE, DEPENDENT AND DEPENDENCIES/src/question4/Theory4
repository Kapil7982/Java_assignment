 Q4. Write Short notes on how the Spring framework evolves.
 
 Answer)  As we know that to build Enterprise Application we have to do many repeated things and that will be very much burden on developer.
          In early days of java based business application development, programmer used multiple java bean classes (normal java classes) to build the
          business logic layer/service layer. The Business logic layer only required the Enterprise capabilities like security, tx-management, 
          logging, mailing, messaging, etc, these enterprise capabilities are also known as extra service to the main business logic or middle were 
          services to make our main business logic perfect.
          
          To overcome this problem in 2004 Rod Jonshon created Spring Framework. Spring is a application f/w software to develop EA. software
          communities treats spring as a framework of frameworks, because it gives the support of various other f/w software also. like hibernate, 
          struts, JSF,etc.
          
          Spring is an open source, light weight application f/w that can be used in all the layers of Java based Enterprise application development.
          With the Spring f/w we can develop J2SE related or J2EE related application as well.
