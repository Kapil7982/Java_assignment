 Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in theDatabase? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to establish these relationships among 
      tables with examples.
     
 Answer)  There are three types of relationship in relational database tables.

		1. One to One relationship
		2. One to Many relationship
		3. Many to Many relationship
		
		1. One to One relationship => It is used to create a relationship between two tables in 
		which a single row of the first table can only be related to one and only one records of a
		second table. Similarly, the second row of the table can also be related to anyone row of
		the first table.
		
		for Eg:
		
		Each person have unique pan id vice versa each pan id has unique member.
		
		One to One
		===========
		
		create table Person(
		pid int primary key,
		pname varchar(12),
		address varchar(12),
		mobile varchar(10),
		email varchar(15),
		);
		
		create table AadharCard(
		AadharCardno int primary key,
		issuedate date,
		personid int unique,
		foreign key (personid) references Person(pid)
		);
		
		2. One to Many relationship => It is used to create a relationship between two tables.Any
		single rows of the first table can be realate to one or more rows of the second tables,
		but the rows of second tables can only relate to the only row in the first table.
		
		for eg:
		
		Each department has many employess
		
		Many to Many
		=============
		
		create table Dept(
		did int primarykey,
		dname varchar(15),
		location varchar(10)
		);
		
		Emp(eid, ename, address, salary, depid ---foreign key references Dept(did));
		
		3. Many to Many relationship => It cretes a relationship between two tables. Each record
		of the first table can relate to any records (or no records) in the second table. Similar
		ly, each record of the second table can also relate to more than one record of the first
		table.
		
		for eg : 
		
		Many student can opt many course and many course are opt by many students.
		
		Many to Many
		
		create table student(
		roll int primary key,
		sname varchar(12),
		address varchar(12),
		mobile varchar(10),
		);
		
		create table course(
		cid int primary key,
		cname varchar(12),
		fee int,
		duration varchar(12),
		);
		
		create table student_course
		(
		roll int,
		cid int,
		foreign key (roll) references student(roll),
		foreign key (cid) references courses(cid)
		);
