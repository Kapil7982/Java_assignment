Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Answer) Static variable:- A static variable is also called a class variable and is common across the objects of the class
         and this variable can be accessed using class name as well.
      
      1. A static variable can be accessed by static members as well as non-static member functions.
      2. A static variable acts as a global variable and is shared among all the objects of the class.
      3. Static variables occupies less space and memory allocation happens once.
      4. A static variable is declared using static keyword.
      
      
      Non-static variable:- Any variable of a class which is not static is called non-static variable or an instance variable.
      
      1. A non-static variable can not be accessed by static member functions.
      2. A non-static variables are specific to instance object in which they are created.
      3. A non-static variable may occupy more space. Memory allocation may happen at run time.
      4. A normal variable is not required to have any special keyword.
