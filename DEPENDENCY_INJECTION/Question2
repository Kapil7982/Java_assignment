 Q2. Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection.
 
 Answer) 
           IOC :-

			1. As we know to make two classes loosely coupled we need to apply dependency injection mechanism and POJO by POJI mechanism.
			2. Earlier we are doing this thing manually but if any external entity or framework do this work then we can say that control is 
			   inverted to that external framework and we called that framework as Inversion Of Control(IOC).
			
			Dependency Injection:
			
			So create two class loosely coupled we need to apply dependency mechanism. There is two way to apply dependency injection.
			
			1)Using Constructor 
			2) Using Setter Method
