Q4) Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?
  
Answer) Method Overloading :-  
        
        Method Overloading is an example of Compile time polymorphism.  In this, more than one method of the same class shares the same method name
        having different signatures. Method overloading is used to add more to the behavior of methods and there is no need of more than one class
        for method overloading.
        
        
        
         Method Overriding :- 
            
         Method overriding is an example of run time polymorphism. In this, the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by 
         the parent class is provided by the child class. It is used to change the behavior of existing methods and there is a need for at least 
         two classes for method overriding. In method overriding, inheritance always required as it is done between parent class(superclass) and 
         child class(child class) methods.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
                    Method Overloading                                                         Method Overriding
          
   1.     In the method overloading, methods or functions                            In the method overriding, methods or functions must
          must have the same name and different signatures.                          have the same name and same signatures.
          
   2.     Method overloading is a example of compile time polymorphism.              Method overriding is a example of run time polymorphism.
  
   3.     In the method overloading, inheritance may or may not be required.         In method overriding, inheritance always required.
   
   4.     Method overloading is performed between methods within the class.          Method overriding is done between parent class and child 
                                                                                     class methods.
   
   5.     It is used in order to add more to the behavior of methods.                It is used in order to change the behavior of 
                                                                                     exist methods.
   
   6.     In method overloading, there is no need of more than one class.            In method overriding, there is need of at least of two classes
