 Question 2) Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.
 Answer)  
            Early Binding:-  The binding can be resolve at compile time by the compiler is called Early Binding.
            
            1. It is a compile time process.
            2. The method definition and the method call are linked during the compile time.
            3. Object is not used for binding.
            4. Method overloading program execution is faster.
            
		           class Dog
		           {  
						private void eat(){System.out.println("Inside dog class..");
					 
							  
							 public static void main(String args[])
							 {  
								  Dog d1=new Dog();  
								  d1.eat();  
	                         }  
}  
            
            
            Late Binding:- In the late binding the compiler doesn't decide the method to be called. overriding is better example of Late Binding.
            
            1. It is a run time process.
            2. The method definition and the method call are linked during the run time.
            3. Actual Object is used for binding.
            4. Method overloading program execution is slower.
            
            
            
            class Animal
            {  
               void eat(){System.out.println("Inside Animal class...");
            
  
				class Dog extends Animal
				{  
				 void eat(){System.out.println("Child of Animal..."); 
				  
				 public static void main(String args[]){  
				  Animal a=new Dog();  
				  a.eat();  
                }  
          }
