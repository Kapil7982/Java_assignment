a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
			
			
			interface A
			{
			   int i = 111;
			}
			
			class B implements A
			{
			    void methodB(){
			i = 222;
			}
			}

			
 Answer)  Because, An if a variable declear in an interface then by default it is final. And if if we reassign or change that variable then it throw
          an error.
