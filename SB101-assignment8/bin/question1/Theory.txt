 Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?
 
 Answer) Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies
         of the program running on the computer. Multithreading can also handle multiple requests from the same user.
         
         Importance:- 
         
         1. It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.
         2. You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
         3. Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.
