 Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?
 
 Answer)  
          Thread 
          
          1. Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread.
          2. It has multiple methods including start() and run().
          3. Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it.
          4. More memory required.
          5. Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java hence after a class extends Thread class, it can not extend any other class
          
          
          Runnable 
          
          1. Runnable is a functional interface which is used to create a thread.
          2. It has only abstract method run().
          3. Multiple threads share the same objects.
          4. Less memory required.
          5. If a class is implementing the runnable interface then your class can extend another class.
