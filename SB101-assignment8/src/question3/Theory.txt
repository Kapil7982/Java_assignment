 Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.
 
 Answer) 
     
           Process:- 
           
           1. Process means any program is in execution.
           2. The process takes more time to terminate.
           3. It takes more time for creation.
           4. It also takes more time for context switching.
           5. The process is less efficient in terms of communication.
           6. Multiprogramming holds the concepts of multi-process.
           7. The process is called the heavyweight process.
           8. Changes to the parent process do not affect child processes.
           9. The process does not share data with each other.
           10. A system call is involved in it
           
           
           Thread:- 
           
           1. Thread means a segment of a process.
           2. The thread takes less time to terminate.
           3. It takes less time for creation.
           4. It takes less time for context switching.
           5. Thread is more efficient in terms of communication.
           6. We donâ€™t need multi programs in action for multiple threads because a single process consists of multiple threads.
           7. A Thread is lightweight as each thread in a process shares code, data, and resources.
           8. Since all threads of the same process share address space and other resources so any changes to the main thread may affect the 
              behavior of the other threads of the process.
           9. Threads share data with each other.
           10. No system call is involved, it is created using APIs.
