 Q3) Explain the difference between abstract class and interface.
 
 Answer) Both abstract and interface used to achieve abstraction where we declare the abstract methods. Abstract class and interface both can't be
         instantiated.
         
         Abstract class:- 
         
         1. Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
         2. Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
         3. Abstract keyword used to declare abstract class.
         4. An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
         5. Abstract class can be extended using "extends" keyword.
         6. A java abstract class can have class members like private, protected etc.
         7. Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
         
         Example:- 
         
         
         public abstract class Shape
         {
			public abstract void draw();
		 }
        
        
         Interface:-  
         
         1. Interface support multiple inheritance.
         2. Interface have only final and static variables.
         3. The "interface" keyword is used to declare interface.
         4. An interface can extend another java interface only.
         5. An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements".
         6. Members of java interface are public by default.
         7. Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
         
         Example:- 
         
         public interface Drawable
         {
			void draw();
		 }
