 Q1/ - Write down some predefined Functional interfaces in the java library at least 4 interfaces, with their methods.
 
 Answer) An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface. It can have any number of default, static methods
         but can contain only one abstract method. It can also declare methods of object class.
         
         Predefined functional interfaces in java:- 
         
         1. Comparable (java.lang.Comparable) :- public int compareTo(Object obj);
		 2. Comparator (java.util.Comparator) :- public int compare(Object obj1, Object obj2);
		 3. Runnable (java.lang.Runnable) :-  public void run();
		 4. Callable (java.util.Concurrent) :- public void callable();
