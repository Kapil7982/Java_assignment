 Answer)  An entity obj has the 3 life-cycle state:-

		1.new state/transient state :- if we create a object of persistence class and this class is not attached with the EM obj, then this stage is
		                               6 known as new state/transient state.
		                               
		                        
		
		2.persistence state/managed state :- if a persistence class obj or Entity obj is associated with EM obj, then this obj will be in persistence
		                                     state.when we call a persist(-) method by supplying Student entity obj then at time student obj will be 
		                                     in persistence state.
		                                     
		                                     Or
		                                     
		                                     when we call find() method and this method returns the Student obj, then that obj will also be in 
		                                     persistence state.
		
		3.detached state :- When we call  close() method   or call clear() method on the EM obj, then all the associated entity obj will be in 
		                    detached state. In this stage the entity objs will not be in-sync with the table.
