 Answer) Hibernate is one ORM software.ORM means object relation mapping. It's means we can map our object directly to database.
		
		Here are some Advantages of hibrenate
		
		1. We can directly map our java objects to database.we dont need to convert it into single atomic value.it reduces the work of developer.
		
		2. Hibernate is database independent software. In hiberante we basically write our logic in the form of java objects. So we can use that code
		   in any database software.where in jdbc we can't do this. Hibernate generate sql query using that logic.In jdbc we have to write that sql 
		   query that depends on database software.
		
		3. In JDBC there is a big boiler plate code too.it is tough to manage the boiler plate code everytime.but in Hibernate there is very less 
		   boiler plate code.
