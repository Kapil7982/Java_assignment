 Answer) Race condition :- In layman terms, a race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to get 
                           certain shared resources.For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to
                            delete the same data.This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error.
