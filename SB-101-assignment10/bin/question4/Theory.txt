 Q4. Explain about thread synchronization(inter-thread communication).
 
 Answer)  Thread synchronization :- Inter-thread communication or Co-operation is all about allowing synchronized threads to communicate with each 
                                    other.Cooperation (Inter-thread communication) is a mechanism in which a thread is paused running in its 
                                    critical section and another thread is allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to be executed.
                                    
          It is implemented by following methods of Object class:- 
          1. wait();
          2. notify();
          3. notify();
