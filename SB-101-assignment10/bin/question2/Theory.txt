 Q2. What is a ThreadPool, how to create a thread pool of 4 threads, and write down the difference between the Callable and Runnable interface.
 
 Answer) ThreadPool :- A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread 
                       cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced 
                       by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
                       
                       
          Creating the thread pool of 4 threads:-
              
          ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
          
          
          Callable interface:- 
          
          1. This thread has property of return.
          2. Only one method public Object call() throws Exception return type is Object.
          3. Not required try-catch block because it throw exception with it's method.
          4. Belong to java.util.concurrent package.
          5. It introduce in java 1.5 version.
          
          
          Runnable interface:- 
          
          1. This thread won't return anything.
          2. Only one method public void run() return type void.
          3. If any exception raise compulsory we need to handle in try-catch block.
          4. Belong to java.land package.
          5. It introduce in java 1.0 version.
