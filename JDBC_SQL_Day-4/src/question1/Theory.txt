 Answer) A JDBC driver (Java Database Connectivity driver) is a small piece of software that allows JDBC to connect to different databases.

        Essentially, a JDBC driver makes it possible to do three things:

		1. Establish a connection with a data source.
		2. Send queries and update statements to the data source.
		3. Process the results.
		
		it is a translation software written in Java according to the JDBC specification (it comes in the form of Jar file.)

		Responsibility of JDBC driver s/w :
		===========================
		
		1. establishing the Connection.
		
		2. receiving the JDBC method calls (java method call ) and translate them into DBMS understandable format.(SQL) and forward them to the DB s/w.
		
		3.Translating the DB s/w given result into the Java format (Java objects) and returns that object toe hte JDBC client.
		
		
		step of connect our java application with the DB server (Mysql):
		==================================================
		
		1. download/get the jdbc driver related jar file (mysql-connector.jar) and set that jar file inside the classpath of our application.
		
		2.Load the Driver related main class into the memory.
		
		3. prepare the Connection string.
		
		4. establish the connection.
		
		5.after performing the CRUD operation close the connection.
