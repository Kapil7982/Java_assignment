 Q2) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exceptions. write some examples of checked and unchecked exception classes.
 
 Answer) In Java, for every occurrence of an exception, there generates an exception object, which holds all the details of the 
         exception. Then the program searches for its respective exception handler. If found, the exception is handled or resolved, or else the 
         program execution stops.
         
         Java generates two types of exceptions:- 
         1. Checked exception
         2. Unchecked exception
         
         
        Checked exception:-
        
        1. The compiler checks a checked exception.
        2. These types of exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation.
        3. They are the sub-class of the exception class.
        4. In checked exception JVM needs catch and handle that exception.
        5. Example of checked exception :- 	File Not Found Exception, No Such Method Exception, Class Not Found Exception etc..
        
        
        
        Unchecked exception:- 
        
        1. The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
        2. These types of exceptions cannot be a catch or handle at the time of compilation, because they get generated by the mistakes in the 
           program.
        3. They are runtime exceptions and hence are not a part of the Exception class.
        4. In unchecked exception JVM doesn't require to catch and handle that exception.
        5. Examples of unchecked exceptions:- Arithmetic Exception, Null Pointer Exception, Undeclared Throwable Exception etc..
