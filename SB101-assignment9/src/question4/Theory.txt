 Q4. What is a Race condition, How will you solve the Race condition,explain with an Example.
  
 Answer)  A race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to get certain shared resources. 
          For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
          
          
         public class Chcek {
         
		    public static void main(String[] args) {
		    
		        Common c1=new Common();
		        Common c2=new Common();
		        ThreadA t1=new ThreadA(c1,"Ram");
		        ThreadB t2=new ThreadB(c2,"Shyam");
		        t1.start();
		        t2.start();
		        
		    }
		}

			class Common{
			   public void fun(String n)
			   {
			       System.out.println(n);
			   }
			}
			
			class ThreadA extends  Thread{
			    Common c1;
			    String name;
			    public  ThreadA(Common c1,String name)
			    {
			        this.c1=c1;
			        this.name=name;
			    }
			    @Override
			    public void  run()
			    {
			
			            System.out.println("Welcome");
			            c1.fun(name);
			
			    }
			
			}
			class ThreadB extends  Thread{
			    Common c1;
			    String name;
			    public  ThreadB(Common c1,String name)
			    {
			        this.c1=c1;
			        this.name=name;
			    }
			    public  void  run(){
			
			            System.out.println("Welcome");
			            c1.fun(name);
			
			    }
			}
			
			
			 In the above code this method will generate race condition because t1 and t2 trying to access run method at same time.
			 so if we add synchronized block there then it will resolve this problem.
