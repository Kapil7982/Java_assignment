 Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.
 
 Answer) Equals and Hashcode method are two important methods in java provided by the object class for comparing the objects. Since the objects 
         class is the parent class of all java objects hence all the objects are inherit the default implementation of those two methods.
         
         
         equals():- 
         
         1. The euqals() method in java is belong to java.lang.Object class, and it is used to compare two objects.
         2. To compare two objects that it whether they are same or not it compares the value of the both the objects attributes.
         3. By default two objects will be the same only if stored in the same memory location.
         4. Syntax :- public boolean equals(Objects obj)
         
         
         Hashcode():- 
         
         1. The hascode() method isa a interger value associated with every object in java facilitating the hashing in hash tables.
         2. To get his hashcode value for an object we can use the hashcode() method in java. It is means hashCode() method return the integer 
            hashcode value of the given object.
            
         3. Since this method is defined in the object clss, hence it is inherited by user defined classes also.
         4. The hashcode() method return the same hash value when called on two objects. Which are equals according to the equals() method. And if 
             the objects are unequal return different hash values.
             
         5 Syntax :- public int hashCode()
