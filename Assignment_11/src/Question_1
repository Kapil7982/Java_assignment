 Q1. Explain the Java-based Spring MVC architecture.
 
 Answer)  Spring MVC means model-view-controller.

		Previously there is MVC model where we use servlet class in that we validate the data which comes from web application then servlet class
		gives that data to service layer to perform business logic service layer called the method from data access layer to perform business logic
	    on client data for that data access layer fetch data from database and gives to data access layer. After that service layer perform the 
	    business logic and it gives back to servlet class.And servlet gives it to JSP beacuse jsp is easy to handle when there is rich UI. So jsp 
	    show the final data to client.
			
		In this servlet works as controller because it is just controlling the flow of whole process. Jsp work as view in this because it presents 
		the data to client and model mean java bean class because in java data stores as object and we are using bean class to create object.
			
		In Spring MVC we don't need this servlet class we can directly use Spring boot framework dispatcher servelt class.we don't need to 
		configure servlet class so it's gives less burden to developer.
