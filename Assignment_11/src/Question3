 Q3. What is the difference between WebApplication and Web-services?
 
 Answer)  Web services is a part of WebApplication.

		1. In WebApplication we can generate a   HTML form like a webpage response. But in Webservice we can get the data in raw form like JSON, 
		   XML etc.
		
		2. In Webapplication we can deploy our HTML page in webserver only like browse software etc. But in Webservice we can use that raw data for
		   browser software or anytype of application in any technology.
		
		3. Webapplication response is not reusable because we deploy in it webserver whereas Web service data is reusable any other application or
		   webapplication use that data and present it's in thier own browser.
