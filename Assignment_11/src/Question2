          HTTP. HTTP is one type of instruction set to communicate between two different technology
			
			HTTP request:
			
			this request is distributed in three parts
			1. Initial request
			
			 i) This initial request is also have 3 parts in which first one is method type there is GET,POST,PUT,DELETE this four methods is there. 
			    We can select any of above method.
			
			 ii) Second part is Uri in that we have to write the page name . Uri means universal resource identifier that identify your HTML page 
			     which will be deploy in web browse.
			
			iii) The last part is version in that we select the HTTP browser ex-1.1,2.x etc.
			
			
			2. Request header :- Second part is request header in that there is data in key value pair Where key is fixed and value will change as
			                     per client request.
			                     
		    i)   Date : Date and time on which request is made from the client.
			ii)  Host: IPaddress of the client.
			iii) User-agent: From which browser the client has generated the request.

			                   format.GET and DELETE method doesn't have any request body.

			                       show a code like 201,299 etc and description it will be mentioned the what that code stands for and version is
			                       same as HTTP request.
