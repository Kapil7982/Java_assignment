 Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?
 
 Answer) 
          Array:- An array is a dynamically-created object. It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values of the same type. 
          It has a contiguous memory location. Once an array is created, we cannot change its size. 
          
          
          1. Array is static in size.
          2. It is mandatory to provide the size of an array while initializing it directly or indirectly.
          3. It performs fast in comparison to ArrayList because of fixed size.
          4. An array can store both objects and primitives type.
          5. We use for loop or for each loop to iterate over an array.
          6. We cannot use generics along with array because it is not a convertible type of array.
          7. We can add elements in an array by using the assignment operator.
          8. Array can be multi-dimensional.
          
          Example:- 
          
          
           int array[]=new int[size]; // Here we are creating an array of specified size. When we try to add more than its size, it throws 
           ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Like
           
           int arr[]=new int[3];  
			 
			arr[0]=12;  
			arr[1]=2;  
			arr[2]=15;  
			arr[3]=67
          
          
          ArrayList :- In simple words ArrayList is class of collections framework. It contains popular classes like Vector, HashTable, and HashMap.
          
          
          1. ArrayList is dynamic in size.
          2. We can create an instance of ArrayList without specifying its size. Java creates ArrayList of default size.
          3. ArrayList is internally backed by the array in Java. The resize operation in ArrayList slows down the performance.
          4. We cannot store primitive type in ArrayList. It automatically converts primitive type to object.
          5. We use an iterator to iterate over ArrayList.
          6. ArrayList allows us to store only generic/ type, that's why it is type-safe.
          7. Java provides the add() method to add elements in the ArrayList.
          8. ArrayList is always single-dimensional.
          
          
           Example:- 
           
           
          public class ArrayExample  { 
           
				public static void main(String args) {  
				   
				    int arr[]=new int[4];  
			
					arr[0]=12;  
					arr[1]=2;  
					arr[2]=15;  
					arr[3]=67;
					  
				for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)  
				{  
				    System.out.println(arr[i]);  
				}  
			}  
}
