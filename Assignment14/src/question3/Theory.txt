 Q3) Explain AutoBoxing and Auto UnBoxing with Examples.
 
 Answer) The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper type is known as boxing and opposite operation is known as 
         UnBoxing. This is the new feature of Java5. So java programmer doesn't need to write the conversion code. One of the biggest advantage of 
         AutoBoxing and UnBoxing is there is no need of conversion between primitives and Wrappers manually so less coding is required.
         
         Example of AutoBoxing:-
         
         class Boxing
         {  
         
			  public static void main(String args[])
			  {  
			    int a=50; 
			     
		        Integer a2=new Integer(a); 
		        Integer a3=5;
          
                System.out.println(a2+" "+a3);  
             }   
       }  
       
       
        Example of UnBoxing:- 
       
        class UnBoxing
        {  
			  public static void main(String args[])
			  {  
			        Integer i=new Integer(50);  
			        int a=i;  
			          
                  System.out.println(a);  
              }   
        }
